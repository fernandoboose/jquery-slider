TODO 

- CSS -> set arrows style
- Slider.js -> set fade() function <br />
			-> find a way to define the CSS transition property in setTrans(), so we can change the image transiction time <br />
			-> show alt and subtitle for each image <br />
			-> change resetInterval function, isn't auto-rotating anymore after running it
