This slider is built with SASS and native Javascript.

Feel free to use on your projects and don't forget to contribute too. :)

TODO 

- CSS -> set arrows style
- Slider.js -> set nested arrows in slider parent (actually beeing defined on main function)
			-> set fade() function
			-> set interval for the slider, it needs to slide automatically too.
			-> find a way to define the CSS transition property in setTrans(), so we can change the image transiction time
			-> show alt and subtitle for each image
