This slider is built with SASS and native Javascript.

Feel free to use on your projects and don't forget to contribute too. :)

TODO 

- CSS -> set arrows style
- Slider.js -> set fade() function <br />
			-> find a way to define the CSS transition property in setTrans(), so we can change the image transition time <br />
			-> show alt and subtitle for each image
